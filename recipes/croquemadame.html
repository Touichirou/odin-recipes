    <h2>Description</h2>
        A croque madame is a baked or fried ham and cheese sandwich 
        served with a poached or lightly frieg egg on top.
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li> 
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
            <li>8 slices thick sourdough bread</li>
            <li>3/4 pound ham</li>
            <li>12 ounces gruyere cheese, grated, divided</li>
            <li>Nonstick spray</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the grill to 180C.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Make the bechamel sauce: In a small saucepan, melt 1 ounce butter over medium heat. 
                Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until you smell the flour and butter 
                cooking, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not allow it to brown. Add the milk and bay leaf and cook, 
                stirring from time to time, until the mixture thickens like a soup, 10 to 12 minutes. 
                Remove the bay leaf and stir in the Parmesan. Transfer to a bowl to cool.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Arrange 4 slices of the bread on a flat surface. Top each with 2 to 3 slices of ham. 
                Mix together half of the Gruyere cheese and the bechamel sauce. Taste for seasoning. 
                Spread a little of the sauce on top of the ham and top each with another slice of bread.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet and, when hot, add half of the remaining butter. Add 2 
                of the sandwiches and brown on one side, 2 minutes. Turn on the other side and brown 2 
                more minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining butter and sandwiches. 
                Spread the remaining bechamel on top of the sandwiches and top with the other half of the Gruyere cheese.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Wipe any crumbs from the cast iron skillet and spray with nonstick spray. Crack 4 eggs into 
                the skillet, leaving a little room between each. (Alternatively, fry 2 at a time). While the 
                eggs are frying, place the sandwiches under the grill and grill until the top becomes 
                golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Season the eggs with salt and top each sandwich with a 
                fried egg. Serve immediately.</li>
